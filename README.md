# Guess-Number

This is basic guessing game in Python. 

The rules for this game are very simple. All you have to do is put in guesses for your number 
and the program will tell you if you are closer or farther away from the number.

You can not choose a number that is less than 1 or greater than 100.
If your guess is within 10 of the number I will tell you WARM and if not then COLD
If you get closer I'll tell you WARMER and if you move away then COLDER.

Enjoy!
